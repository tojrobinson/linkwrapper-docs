#Links

There are currently three supported types of links that can be added to your **LIRBRARY**: YouTube, Vimeo, and SoundCloud. The [Quick Start](/docs/quick-start) section covers the ways in which you can start adding them to your [collections](/docs/lists#collections).

##Playing Links
You can play your wrapped links in a number of ways, depending on your preference:

- double clicking a link
- clicking the ![play](/img/playIcon.png) button (appears on hover)
- right clicking the link and selecting the **Play** option

##Editing Links
Once you have some links in your **LIBRARY**, you may wish to edit their auto generated details or move them between your [collections](/docs/lists#collections). In order to do so, bring up the **link menu** by either right-clicking a link in the current list (or clicking the ![link menu](/img/linkMenu.png) button) and select the **Details** option.

##Deleting Links
Within the **link menu**, you will either have a **Delete** or **Remove** option depending on what type of list you currently have loaded. 

**Deleting** a link will remove all instances of it from both your **LIBRARY** and **PLAYLISTS**. On the other hand, **removing** a link will simply remove the selected instance/s of it; all other instances will remain.

> You can select multiple links at once using the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd> keys.
