#Lists
**linkwrapper** supports two main list types: collections and playlists. Your **LIBRARY** is composed of collections while the **PLAYLISTS** section contains—you guessed it—playlists. The two list types serve distinct purposes and as such have defining characteristics; these are outlined below.

##Collections
Collections are the type of list found in your **LIBRARY** and can contain up to **500** links in each. All links found in your **LIBRARY** (the cumulative set of links in collections) are unique, even across different collections.

> Attempting to add a link that currently exists in your **LIBRARY** will result in an error notification informing you of its location.

Collections store the **root** or **original** copy of links that are in turn referenced by playlists. This means that when changes are made to a link's details, they are propagated throughout all the instances of it in your playlists.

Collections can be sorted alphabetically (or numerically in the case of **Plays**) by clicking the column headings:

![sort list](/img/docs/sortList.png)

> Clicking a column heading more than once will toggle the order in which the items are sorted.

Collections are populated with links in the manor outlined in the [Intro](/docs/intro#adding-links) section.

##Playlists

Unlike collections, playlists can contain duplicate links and enforce a maximum of 100 links per playlist. You will also notice that playlists cannot be sorted by their column headings; this is due to the strict ordering that playlists possess. If you wish to reorder the items in a playlist, you can do so via the drag handle ![grab link](/img/grabLink.png) on the far right of the wrapped link.

Playlists are populated with links from your **LIBRARY**. In order to add links to a playlist, select one or more from a collection and right-click one of the selected items (or click [link menu](/img/linkMenu.png)) and select **Add to playlist** ![add to playlist](/img/rightArrow.png). You can then select the playlist to which you would like to add the selected links.

> Removing links from a playlist via the link menu (described [here](/docs/intro#editing-links)) will only remove the currently selected instances. It will not effect duplicate entries or the original version in your **LIBRARY**. Deleting them from your **LIBRARY**, however, will remove them both from the collection and all playlists.

##Creating Lists
Within the ![add menu](/img/add.png) menu, you will find the **New Collection** ![collection icon](/img/libraryIcon.png) and **New Playlist** ![playlist icon](/img/playlistsIcon.png) options. These will allow you to create either a collection or a playlist respectively.

##Editing Lists
You may wish to rename, delete, or reorder some of your lists after you have created them. In order to do this, click the ![cog](/img/cog.png) next to **LIBRARY** or **PLAYLISTS** (you may need to hover over them for it to appear) to enable edit mode.

![edit lists](/img/docs/editLists.png)

Here you will be able to edit the title by clicking ![edit list](/img/rename.png), delete the list (along with any links it may contain) by clicking ![delete list](/img/remove.png), or grab and reorder it with ![grab list](/img/grabList.png).
