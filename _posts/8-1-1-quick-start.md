##Adding Links
There are four ways in which you can start adding links to your **LIBRARY**:

- Extract them from a bookmarks file
- Add them individually
- Search for them (e.g. via YouTube)
- Add suggested links

###Existing links
The first two options allow you to add links you might already have. From the ![add menu](/img/add.png) menu, you can choose to either add links individually or extract many of them from a file (e.g. a bookmarks file):

![extract](/docs/img/extract.png)

> For more information on how to obtain a bookmarks file to extract links from, read through the [extraction section](/docs/extract).

###Finding New Links
You can also search external sources for new links via the search box. By default, it will search the currently displayed list; however, you can change the search target by clicking the icon in the left portion of the search box:

![search menu](/docs/img/search.png)

An external search will result in a list of playable results. You can add a result to your library by clicking the ![add one](/img/addOneIcon.png) button in the bottom right corner of the result.

Similarly, whenever you play a link, related streams will appear to the right of the main player view that you can play. The ![add one](/img/addOneIcon.png) button will appear next to the **now playing** box when you play related streams:

![add related](/docs/img/addRelated.png)

> Links in your **LIBRARY** are unique, even across [collections](/docs/lists#collections). This is not the case for **PLAYLISTS** which can contain as many duplicates as you wish.

You should now have a collection of links that you can start playing. For more informatiion on how to interact and manage your links, read through the [Links](/docs/links) and [Lists](/docs/lists) sections.
