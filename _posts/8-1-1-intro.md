#Getting Started

##Layout

##Adding Links
There are four ways in which you can start adding links to your **LIBRARY**:

- Extract them from a bookmarks file
- Add them individually
- Search for them (e.g. via YouTube)
- Add suggested links

###Existing links
From the ![add menu](/img/add.png) menu, you can choose to either add links individually or extract many from a file such as a bookmarks file:

![extract](/img/docs/extract.png)

> For more information on how to obtain a bookmarks file to extract links from, read through the [extraction section](/docs/extract).

###Finding New Links
By default the search box will search for links locally in the selected list; however, you can change the search target by clicking the icon in the left portion of the search box:

![search menu](/img/docs/search.png)

An external search will result in a list of playable results. You can add a result to your library by clicking the ![add one](/img/addOneIcon.png) button in the bottom right corner of the result.

Whenever you play a link, related streams will appear to the right of the player view. You can play any of these by clicking on them. The ![add one](/img/addOneIcon.png) button will appear next to the **now playing** box when you do:

![add related](/img/docs/addRelated.png)

> Links in your **LIBRARY** are unique, even across [collections](/docs/lists#collections). This is not the case for **PLAYLISTS** which can contain as many duplicates as you wish.

##Editing Links
Now that you have some links in your **LIBRARY**, you may wish to edit, delete, or move them between [collections](/docs/lists#collections). In order to do so, bring up the link menu by either right-clicking a link in the current list (or clicking the ![link menu](/img/linkMenu.png) button).

> You can select multiple links at once using the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd> keys.
